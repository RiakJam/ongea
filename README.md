## 💡 The Problem We’re Solving

Today’s social media landscape is **dominated by popularity bias** — where only influencers and highly followed users gain visibility.  
This creates frustration and discouragement among everyday users who want their voices heard.

Ongea Ikutoke solves this by addressing:

### 1. **Visibility Inequality**
- Traditional platforms reward popularity over contribution.
- **Solution:** Our algorithm gives equal visibility to high-quality content from all users.

### 2. **Superficial Engagement**
- Likes and follows often overshadow genuine interaction.
- **Solution:** Encourage meaningful conversations through topic-based communities and thoughtful engagement features.

### 3. **Community Fragmentation**
- Users struggle to find authentic, localized, or interest-based communities.
- **Solution:** Built-in discovery tools help connect people through shared goals, hobbies, and causes.

### 4. **Data & Privacy Concerns**
- Many platforms exploit user data for ads and profit.
- **Solution:** Transparent data use policies and privacy-first design.
