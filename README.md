## 💡 The Problem We’re Solving

Today’s social media landscape is **dominated by popularity bias** — where only influencers and highly followed users gain visibility.  
This creates frustration and discouragement among everyday users who want their voices heard.

Ongea Ikutoke solves this by addressing:

### 1. **Visibility Inequality**

- **Solution:** Encourage meaningful conversations through topic-based communities and thoughtful engagement features.

### 3. **Community Fragmentation**
- Users struggle to find authentic, localized, or interest-based communities.  
- **Solution:** Built-in discovery tools help connect people through shared goals, hobbies, and causes.
